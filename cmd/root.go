	Use:   "wkv",
	Short: "wsend-key-value-store",
	Long: `wsend key value store is command line tool to store
a value based on a key some examples include:

wkv create --name="foo"
To create a store

wkv store --store-link="https://wsnd.io/IdGzDoh/foo" --key="bar" --value="baz" --type="string"
this will store the value "bar" at the key "foo" and it's of type string
which is the default if type was "file" then it would attempt to upload the
file specified. In either case a file always gets uploaded because the string
value can be very large and it makes more sense to be flexible.

wkv get --store-link="https://wsnd.io/IdGzDoh/foo" --key="bar"
will print the contents of the value to stdout

wkv remove --store-link="https://wsnd.io/IdGzDoh/foo" --key="bar"
to remove the key and associated value and file.
